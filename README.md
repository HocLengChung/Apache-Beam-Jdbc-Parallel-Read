# Apache-Beam-Jdbc-Parallel-Read
This GitHub repo contains example code for reading a JDBC source using JdbcIO in parallel. 

With this example code you can read JDBC source without getting out of memory issues with Apache Beam/Dataflow.

See my blog here https://github.com/HocLengChung/Apache-Beam-Jdbc-Parallel-Read for an in depth explanation of the code.
